                            <h1>Michigan Daily Projects</h1>

                            <p><span class="image right"><img src="images/mdaily.png" alt="" /></span> 
                                <h2>Style Guide:</h2>
                                Currently, I am working with a group of 4 other designers on the Michigan Daily Web Team to create a brand identity throughout all Michigan Daily web products (Website, Mobile Application, Grade Guide, etc). One of our main goals this semester has to start ideating a new <i>style guide</i> as a resource for other designers and interested audiences to gain insight on the design choices and brand identity guidelines at the Daily. <br> <br>
                                To do this, we identified the main purposes of each of our products, which included generating revenue for TMD, creating accessible information for the general Ann Arbor public, gaining diverse perspectives on a variety of topics, and more. We also evaluated the lack of identity our products currently contain. We then decided on coherent typography and color palette choices and identified structural problems with each product that we aimed to fix. <br> <Br> This is currently an ongoing project & our final product will be updated soon. <br> <br>
                              
                              
                               <h2>Website:</h2>
                            As part of our re-branding on the website, we were also tasked to <i>redesign</i> the current Michigan Daily website. When looking at the website, we identified many user experience flaws and structural issues that we aimed to fix. Among these included implementing a better grid system to eliminate a lot of the dead space within the layout, to redesign the header/landing to be more consistent with brand identity and to be more accessible to users, the card displays, author pages, author bios, navigational system, social media icons and placement, footer, etc. This is also an ongoing project & has not yet been completed. Below is the beginning drafts of our wireframes - will update soon!<br> <br>
