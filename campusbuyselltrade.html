                        <b>Assignment:</b> For my Digital Product Design Class, ENTR390, I was assigned to design a digital product of my choice. <br> <br>
                                 <b>Duration:</b> 1 month (March-April 2020) <br>
                                 <b>Tools:</b> Adobe Illustrator, Figma  <br>
                                 <b></b><br>
                                 
                          <b>Problem Statement:</b>
College students and newly graduated job seekers often have a low income and want to be able to buy furniture and clothes at a cheaper price than they would at the stores. How might we make these resources more easily accessible to these audiences?

                       
                    <br> <br>
                            <b>Target Audience:</b><ul>
<li>College students looking for new clothes </li>
<li>Newly moved in college students looking for home decorations, etc</li>
<li>Recent college grads looking to get rid of their items</li>
<li>Recently hired grads who are looking to find cheap furniture in new apartments</li>
                            </ul>
                            

                            <b><h1>Design Process:</h1></b>
                            <ul>
                            <li>First, I determined the problem statement by surveying through struggles that I commonly have as a college student. From here, I determined the frequency of other people’s struggles and developed my needs hypothesis. </li>
                            <li>Next, I determined personas and user scenarios to more clearly identify user-flows and what features should be established within the application. To clearly understand my audience, I developed two <strong>personas</strong> that highlighted the use cases I envisioned for the application.</li></ul>

                              After developing personas, I began to create user sketches and iterations to gauge a better understanding of what features should be incorporated in the application and what kind of features it should have. I narrowed them down to: <br><br><ul>
                             <li>
Posting about what they need to find</li>
<li>Buying from pages with filter functions</li>
<li>Selling page that allows users to post their items as well as easily monitor and track their posts/pending offers</li>
<li>Profile Page</li>
<li>Messaging Page</li>

             <h2>Wireframes:</h2>
    After my initial sketches, I created basic wireframes on Figma of the main functions and pages that I would be creating. This included specific filter and messaging functions on top of the main buying/selling pages. This would give me a better starting point when creating my first draft of mockups.

             <h2>Style Guide:</h2>
    Before delving into designing and creating my solution, I first defined the color palettes, logotype, as well as the typography and basic UI elements for my application. I created the logotype with inspiration of a "shopping cart", which I created in illustrator. By establishing the style guide, I was able to create consistent layouts throughout all the pages.

                 My final product was an application titled "Campus Buy Sell Trade", which is an application for users to easily buy, sell, and trade their items on university campuses. Although similar applications exist, this application is designed so that people are able to find things more easily with implemented filter and search functions. Within the design, I made share to create a fixed and simple navigation bar with the main pages on the bottom.

								The goal of the posts page is to allow users to post items that they're searching for in a more specific way. The primary functions of this page is for users to post their own search, comment on other's posts to help them find what they're looking for. I kept the functionality simple so that the app remained intuitive to use.

The divided "For You" page allows a more curated feed for individual users to have "saved tags" based on previous searches.

The "Create Post" button is at the top of the page as the highlight of the page. On specific post pages, I also made the ability for users to mark certain items as sold.

                 <h2>Profile & Messaging</h2>
								Profiles and messaging help users to communicate with their buyers/sellers to make communication more transparent. On profiles, users have the ability to change their campus locations as well as show their contact information. In terms of messaging, users have the ability to "Mark Items Sold" or "Bought" so that both buyers and sellers can rate each other. This allows more honesty throughout the system.

                 <h2>Instructor Feedback</h2>
                 After completing drafts, I received general UI feedback and functionality feedback which I implemented. Some of the feedback I received is below:<br> <br>
                 
                 <b>Issue 1:</b>
				Original design had a lot of modal boxes for each time you would click on a post, there would be a “pop-up” that could be closed with the X button. While the functionality wasn’t confusing, pop-up modals are typically more indicative of notifications so try to make these screens into separate pages. (As shown on right) <br> <br>





                 <b>Resulting Actions: </b>Changed the layout of the app to become separate pages with a back button which also made the overall “post” to be more consistent with the aesthetic of the application. 
                 <br> <br>
                 <b>Issue 2:</b> Original design had dark blue comments with white text, which made the visibility somewhat poor and the comments themselves look more like text messages. Potentially lighten the color of the comment boxes.

<br> <br>





                 <b>Resulting Actions:</b> Reduced the weight and color of the comment text itself and the background color of comment boxes to increase text visibility and improve general usability.

                    <b><h1>Next Steps & Changes</h1></b>
                 <ul>
                 <li>Some things I would've changed would've been to conduct more thorough research before starting my process. While I had the input of others to develop my needs hypothesis, I would've gathered more concrete evidence of needs.</li>
                 <li>More usability testing. While I got to conduct a few usability tests that helped me fix some issues, given more time, I would’ve done more extensive testing and implemented some more of the changes based on the results.
