                           <h1>Design Thinking & Design Jam</h1>
          
<h2>Design Jam w/ Lucidpress</h2>
            <b>Overview:</b>
I participated in a design jam session with Lucidpress to design a solution for their onboarding process with a group of 4 other people. 
<br> <br>
            <b>Timeline:</b>
3 hours
<br> <br>
            <b>Problem Statement:</b><br>
Lucidpress has thousands of new users on a daily basis but they have a hard time retaining these users due to their difficult onboarding process. Because the product is so unfamiliar to many users, Lucidpress wanted us to brainstorm solutions for them to improve retention and engagement within the product. 
<br> <br>
            <b>Context:</b><br>
A 3 hour employer session with Lucidpress when they came to the University of Michigan campus for recruitment. 
<br> <br>
We were given a packet of information regarding one specific user persona, Jenny, who was a professional seeking help to create a diagram for her company. She was in her mid-20’s and was working in a professional setting.
<br>

                            </article></div> 
                        
We tried to solve the main issues that we found parsing through user interviews that the initial sign up processes was too long which meant that many users didn’t feel the need to complete the process, that it was hard to find the tutorials to successfully create a new document, that there were too many functions that were poorly explained so that the user felt overwhelmed, and that there were too many popups in general for the entirety of the application. To combat these issues, we came up with a variety of different wireframes that targeted different problems in the different stages of onboarding.

<br> <br>
            <b>Design:</b><br>
Although I did not have the opportunity to take a picture of our final wireframes during the challenge, I quickly recreated wireframes of the first few pages that we drew:

            <b>Summary:</b><br>
This was my very first design jam and although we did not win the challenge, I learned a lot about immersing myself as the user and parsing through user interviews to gain more information and determine user requirements.

            <h2>Bath Mat Product Redesign</h2>

            <b>Overview:</b>
We were given a task to find a daily household item or service and redesign its service based on user feedback. This was a quick project developing user interviewing and user empathy skills developed in my month-long, 3 credit study abroad course. This was a project done by a team of 4 other people.
<br> <br>
            <b>Timeline:</b>
3 days
            <br> <br>

            <b>Contributions:</b>
User research, prototyping<br>
<br>
            
            <b>Goals:</b> 
Create a product that solved the primary issues people found with a daily shower experience.<br><br>

            <b>Sample Interview Questions:</b><br>
Can you describe how you get out of a shower?<br>
Follow up -- what are some struggles you face?<br>
Have you ever slipped while stepping out of the shower?		<br>
Describe your current bath mat.<br>

What do you think the purpose of the bath mat is?<br>
Have you thought of a bath mat with other functionalities such as blow drying mat or heat up mat?<br>
Which would you likely use it? Why?<br>
What could you improve about your current bath mat?<br><br>

            <b>Feedback:</b><br>
Many people struggle with the coldness when getting out of the shower<br>
People dislike having wet floors despite the mat<br>
Functionality and cost matter more than aesthetic<br>
Using different fabrics/materials/shapes<br>
Stick to the ground so it doesn’t move around<br>
Hygiene is an issue<br>
Doesn’t dry quickly/ annoying to clean or dry<br>
            <br>

            <b>Prototypes:</b><br>
From our feedback, we realized that our target audience was not truly interested in a dryer mat. It was not very functional in the quick time that it takes for them to get out of the shower. The excess water left on floors as well as the texture that they personally preferred was more important. With this in mind we pivoted to focusing more on functionality and affordance.<br> <br>
            Our target audience is people with shared bathrooms or those who have their own homes or apartments. Typically being well established, such as individuals who are 30-years-old and older. <br><br>

                            </article></div> 
                
 
    
            <br> <br>
            
            <b>Conclusion</b><br>
Our final design is a bath mat with 3 different layers. The first layer will be a removable layer where each customer can customize it to their own features, such as whether the mat is memory foam (for comfort), thin (for simplicity), heats up (for warmth), has essential oils (to prevent bacterial growth), pink, blue, etc. Since the first layer is removable, it also allows it to be washed easily. The second layer is a layer of porous silicon where excess water from the first layer can drain down into the second layer. This allows the first layer to dry quicker since water is not sitting in the first layer. The silicone allows the second layer to be cleaned easily and the water will seep down to the third layer, which is made of flex tape. With the water sitting in the third layer, flex tape will create a watertight seal with the floor, which prevents the mat from slipping and moving after one gets out of the shower.
<br><br>
The second and third layers are permanently attached and it works better because it incorporates the idea of not having one universal product, but also having add ons. This way, the first layer can easily be replaced when it gets moldy, allowing the second and third layers to be kept, cleaned, and reused by the customer while the customer changes the top layer. This also allows different people of the same household to replace the top layer to their preference when they shower.
